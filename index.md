Hi, I am Muhammad Uzair Khattak, a Computer Vision Master research student in the <a href="https://mbzuai-cv-lab.netlify.app//">Computer Vision Lab</a> at <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae">Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence </a>. I am advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=M59O9lkAAAAJ">Dr. Salman Khan</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zvaeYnUAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Fahad Khan</a>. At MBZUAI, my overall research focus is on <b>object recognition and detection using multi-modal (text and vision) transformers </b>. Currently, I am carrying research on <b>prompt learning for adapting large-scale vision-language models for few-shot and zero-shot learning</b>. 
<br>
Before joining MBZUAI, I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from the National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan. My Undergrad studies has been more focused on Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Embedded Systems. 
<br>
Till now I have completed a number of internships which have helped me both professionally and technically. I am passionate about moving forward in those domains. My goal in life is to become a successful researher that will enable me to contribute in the betterment of the society using my experience and knowledge. My hobbies include playing computer games, table-tennis, teaching, and movies, and most importantly hanging out with my friends.
