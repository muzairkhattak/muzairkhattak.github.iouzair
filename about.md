Before joining MBZUAI, I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from the <a href="https://nust.edu.pk/">National University of Sciences and Technology </a>, Pakistan. At NUST, I was affiliated with <a href="https://dll.seecs.nust.edu.pk/projects/">Deep Learning Lab (DLL) SEECS</a> and Signal Processing and Machine Learning Lab (SIGMA). My Undergrad studies has been more focused on Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Embedded Systems.

Till now I have completed a number of internships which have helped me both professionally and technically. I am passionate about moving forward in those domains. My goal in life is to become a successful researher that will enable me to contribute in the betterment of the society using my experience and knowledge. My hobbies include playing computer games, table-tennis, teaching, and movies, and most importantly hanging out with my friends.
