Till now I have completed a number of internships which have helped me both professionally and technically. I am passionate about moving forward in those domains. My goal in life is to become a successful researher that will enable me to contribute in the betterment of the society using my experience and knowledge. My hobbies include playing computer games, table-tennis, teaching, and movies, and most importantly hanging out with my friends.
